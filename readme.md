# NYU Login Page Verify

You don't want to accidentally type your NYU password into an immitation web page. However, check the URL everytime you log in? Too much strain on your eyes. Let this extension check that for you! 

When the URL is "https://shibboleth.nyu.edu/", it shows a "Safe" pop up message. When the URL is similar but not identical, we suspect a spoof, thus showing a warning pop up. 

Do: allow notification!  
Never: type in NYU password when you don't see a "Safe" pop up!
